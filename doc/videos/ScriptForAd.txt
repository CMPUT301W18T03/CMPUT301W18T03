Let's say you need to paint your fence, but you're going on vacation.

Or you and your spouse get invited to an important diner, but someone needs to watch the kids.

Maybe you need to deliver a package, but you get called into the office.  How would you get any of these tasks done?

Introducing TaskIt.  TaskIt allows you request a service at the price you want to pay.  Other users will then bid for your business, giving you the best service at the lowest price.

You can also requests tasks offline.  You can create a task while in airplane mode, and the task will upload to the cloud once you have cell service or wifi again.

Register, create a profile, request a task, and wait for people to bid to do your task.

TaskIt, the new way to get things done.
